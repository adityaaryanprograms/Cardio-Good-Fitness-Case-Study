# Cardio Good Fitness Case Study

## Problem Statement
CardioGood Fitness is facing a challenge in understanding the distinct profiles of customers for its different treadmill products. The market research team at AdRight needs to determine if there are significant differences in customer characteristics across these product lines. To achieve this, we can perform a thorough descriptive analysis of data collected on various customer attributes from recent purchases of their products.

## Description
The dataset consists of 180 rows and 9 columns which detail different customer demographics. Several outliers discovered in 'Age', 'Education', 'Income' and 'Miles' columns were replaced with the lower and upper quartiles of the respective columns. The customer data was analyzed to shed light on patterns and insights that differentiate the customer base for each product.

## Outcome
Three different customer profiles were developed for each treadmill option on the basis of insights from the data to help DataCo tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer targeting.
